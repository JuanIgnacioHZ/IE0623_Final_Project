# IE0623_Final_Project

Final project for Microprocessors course of the School of Electrical Engineering, UCR

The task was to develop an RTOS for a radar system simulated with the push of two buttons and all the drivers involved in the process, everything in Freescale assembly language for a Dragon12+ training board using an HCS12 microntroller.

The requirements for the project were to develop the following:

    - A timing machine for scheduling electrical signals.
    - A BIOS section for initializing all the hardware.
    - Functions for computing the speed of a car from the input of two digital lines and a timer.
    - Interface for printing text to the LCD display.
    - Three modes of operation: Inactive, Configuration, and Active.
    - Drivers for:
        - LCD display.
        - Push buttons.
        - LED lights.
        - RGB LED light.
        - Numeric keypad.
        - Analog to digital converter.
        - 7 segment displays.
        - Handling of BCD numbers.

Also, the final report of the project was included in the PDF file.
